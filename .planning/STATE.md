# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Surface actionable, data-backed intelligence on the Iran conflict in real-time on an interactive 2.5D map -- numbers over narratives.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Theme

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Project Scaffolding & Theme)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase 1 complete
Last activity: 2026-03-14 -- Phase 1 Plan 01 completed

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 5min
- Total execution time: 0.08 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Project Scaffolding & Theme | 1 | 5min | 5min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Deck.gl + MapLibre for 2.5D map (GPU-accelerated, free)
- React 19 + Vite 6 + TypeScript 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 (from research)
- Zustand 5 for state management
- Express 5 as API proxy
- Common MapEntity interface to normalize all data sources
- Used Tailwind CSS v4 CSS-first @theme configuration (no tailwind.config.js)
- Pinned TypeScript to ~5.9.3 to avoid TS 6.0 breaking changes
- Zustand store uses curried create<UIState>()() pattern for type inference
- Z-index scale defined as CSS custom properties for consistent overlay layering

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- API rate limits on free tiers (OpenSky, AIS) may constrain refresh rates
- ACLED data has inherent delay (hours/days) -- set user expectations in UI
- 5K+ simultaneous entities may impact frame rate -- plan for viewport culling
