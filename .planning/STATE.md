# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-13)

**Core value:** Surface actionable, data-backed intelligence on the Iran conflict in real-time on an interactive 2.5D map -- numbers over narratives.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Base Map

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Base Map)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Plan 02-01 complete, Plan 02-02 next
Last activity: 2026-03-14 -- Phase 2 Plan 01 completed

Progress: [██████░░░░] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.13 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Project Scaffolding & Theme | 1 | 5min | 5min |
| 2. Base Map | 1 | 3min | 3min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5min), 02-01 (3min)
- Trend: Improving

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Deck.gl + MapLibre for 2.5D map (GPU-accelerated, free)
- React 19 + Vite 6 + TypeScript 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 (from research)
- Zustand 5 for state management
- Express 5 as API proxy
- Common MapEntity interface to normalize all data sources
- Used Tailwind CSS v4 CSS-first @theme configuration (no tailwind.config.js)
- Pinned TypeScript to ~5.9.3 to avoid TS 6.0 breaking changes
- Zustand store uses curried create<UIState>()() pattern for type inference
- Z-index scale defined as CSS custom properties for consistent overlay layering
- Mocked maplibre-gl and @deck.gl/mapbox via vite.config.ts test.alias for jsdom compatibility
- Used it.todo() for unimplemented component stubs to avoid import errors while keeping test presence
- DeckGLOverlay wraps MapboxOverlay via useControl hook from react-maplibre

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- API rate limits on free tiers (OpenSky, AIS) may constrain refresh rates
- ACLED data has inherent delay (hours/days) -- set user expectations in UI
- 5K+ simultaneous entities may impact frame rate -- plan for viewport culling
